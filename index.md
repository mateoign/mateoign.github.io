## What I Do

I've dabbled in many data science applications in the last few years. Training Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision models, and data visualizations using Tableau with SQL servers.


## What I've Done Before

### [Customer Engagement Rapid Assistance](https://brandonluong.github.io/CERA/) 2024
Most recently I worked with San Diego Gas & Electric to build a prototype for a mobile app called [CERA](https://brandonluong.github.io/CERA/) that would bring the community closer to SDG&E. CERA was designed for customers to send images of equipment like poles or transformers that appear hazardous directly to a specialist before sending a response team. This would reduce chances of equipment failure leading to larger consequences like wildfires, while improving communication between the public and SDG&E, and reducing potential wasted resources by sending out a team in person. The final result was 2 models that created an urgency score of the equipment condition and a design for the user interface. 


### [TREND](https://trend.ucsd.edu/) 2023-2024
I worked as the Web Development Team Lead for Trend Magazine, a student run organization that releases two issues a year for Fall and Spring. I led a team of 3 to redesign the website for each issue and created multiple short form videos in collaboration with the photography team. Completely coded with React.JS and designed with Figma.
