From 2023 to 2024 I was lead web developer for San Diego based magazine, TREND.  Along with an engineer and designer we redesigned the website over 9 months.

<!-- Working on this website required updating information for their issue releases, blog posts, and team information. The website was built with the React.js framework per request of the owners. -->

Adorn is a prototype for a storefront for my own closet. I made the frontend, backend, and database for the inventorym users, and orders.


### [Customer Engagement Rapid Assistance](https://brandonluong.github.io/CERA/){:target="_blank"} 2024
Most recently I worked with San Diego Gas & Electric to build a prototype for a mobile app called [CERA](https://brandonluong.github.io/CERA/) that would bring the community closer to SDG&E. CERA was designed for customers to send images of equipment like poles or transformers that appear hazardous directly to a specialist before sending a response team. This would reduce chances of equipment failure leading to larger consequences like wildfires, while improving communication between the public and SDG&E, and reducing potential wasted resources by sending out a team in person. The final result was 2 models that created an urgency score of the equipment condition and a design for the user interface. 

## What I Do

I am interested in visual representations for communication.
